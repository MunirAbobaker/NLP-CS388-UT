# NLP_Done_Right

*Please cite this repository if you use any of the code in your research*

This repository is a demonstration on how to modularly write re-usable code for NLP for research/production. Kind of trying to bridge/merge my experiences in both academia and industry. A single codebase with many shared functions across several common NLP tasks. 

I hope you benefit from this to quickly spin up new peojects and not write everything from scratch.
Also please **NEVER** write flat python main.py files with 2000 lines of code ( A huge problem I have noticed in academia and also among many researchers in industry) .  

*Remember : Well writen code = Highly productive research*

**Framework** PyTorch
